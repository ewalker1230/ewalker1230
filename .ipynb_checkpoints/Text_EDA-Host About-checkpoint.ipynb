       "'I live in Boston and I like to travel and have travelers staying at my place. I am a middle-aged, single male with a wide range of interests and creative outlets.  I have traveled frequently, in much of the world, especially central Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia. In recent years I have had many trips to Mexico, where I buy folk art for my online business, called Viva Oaxaca Folk Art. I love meeting new people, especially travelers with stories to tell.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the above, I run web sites for small companies, including a physical therapy practice, a cancer treatment center and a colonial era historic house and museum. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, I was a publicist and concert producer, and have presented many concerts with Judy Collins, as well as with Ella Fitzgerald, Laura Nyro, Tom Rush, Barbara Cook and Karen Akers. Now I run a channel on YouTube called \"beta.hifi.archive\" that is a collection of 50 years of video clips from the career of Judy Collins. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo come to Boston, and stay with me. Enjoy some tomatoes and cucumbers from my garden, explore my world of Mexican folk art, and let\\'s talk about our travel adventures.\\r\\n My husband and I live on the property.  He’s a lawyer and I work as an hospital administration.  We have an additional housemate who lives there during the week but is usually away on the weekends.  We absolutely love having guests over because it makes our big house feel full.  We love reading, watching movies, listening to music, going to concerts, traveling, eating new and different kinds of food and exploring in general.  In addition, I enjoy singing as my hobby.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe want you too feel at home while you are staying with us.  If we are at the house during your visit, we will provide you with breakfast treats and be there to assist you with any of your needs.  The house if often empty on weekends as we all enjoy spending time outside doing activities, meeting friends/family or traveling.  If we are present, we can provide a hot breakfast but if not, cereal, bread, butter, jam, eggs and milk along with pancake mix will be available.  We will provide a list of contacts you can contact if we are not at home.  Our house is incredibly comfortable and we hope you enjoy the experience of sleeping on the beautiful king sized bed with plush down bedding.  We also hope you enjoy access to the movie channels on the Smart TV which is in the living area attached to your bedroom.   I work full time for a public school district.   My two wonderful adult sons live in their own homes in Boston.  Camping, bicycling, music, reading, and quiet time with friends and family are what I enjoy.  I love going to church and being part of the church community. Boston is a great place to live and every day I am happy to be here!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy hosting style is \"available\" but not \"hovering\"!  Some people want to be completely on their own and others like a little connection and appreciate the host being available.  I am happy to accommodate your style. nan American, Retired Banker. I travel a lot and am a good tennis player.\\r\\n I have 3 sons (1 in college, one just graduated from college and one graduated 2 years ago and is working).

We love traveling and adventuring around the world as a family. We like learning other cultures and enjoy good food as well as skiing and sailing. We love Boston and we hope you do too!! nan nan Young couple with extra room to host tourists or people from the States making a short trip to the area. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor tourists- one of us was born and raised in the area, and the other came here for college and has been living in the city for 8 years now, so we have a wealth of knowledge and experience with everything you might want to make your visit to Boston an amazing experience ! nan I\\'m a professor of physics at Northeastern University, born and raised in California. nan nan Option 1: Urban Oasis, which is available every day, all year round, is a lovely, cozy, one bedroom mini-apartment, complete with a gorgeous patio and gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption 2: The PINK ROOM, available every day all year round, is a beautiful private room in our three bedroom home. This custom built (by me, with help) house, is an urban artist\\'s paradise that feels like a cottage in the woods. \\r\\n\\r\\nA BIT ABOUT ME: \\r\\nIf I were to pick two single, most important characteristics to describe in myself, I\\'d choose that I am an artistic maker of things & spaces, and that I adore being a person. \\r\\n\\r\\nHMMM... WHAT DO I LIKE?  \\r\\nWell, I\\'m an avid and high-speed reader. The apartment, the Pink Room, and my home are filled with books. \\r\\nLanguage, for me, holds an endless fascination. While I am not multi-lingual, I consider communication a most important human activity. Telling and listening is, when practiced, what brings the world together. Additionally, my daughter, who is still at home and often my co-host, is fully bi-lingual in Russian and English, as well as being fairly proficient in ASL. We both have some Spanish. My hope is that guests trust that whatever their point of origin, they will feel comfortable here.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeeling at home in the world, for myself, my family, and others, has always been a vital theme for me. I\\'ve lived and worked on St. Kitts in the West Indies, hosted several different exchange students from Russia, given  presentations about Solar Energy in Kenya, lived in the woods in Northern Vermont, worked with trauma survivors for much of my career, taught building skills and trades work, and in these last many years, found a way to thrive in an urban environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a mother of 3 and \\'Babaka\\' now to two grandchildren, my core beliefs about staying in my own integrity, living out of my deepest artistic sensibility, and trying with a tenacity that never stops, have served me well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy style as a host for Airbnb is to offer, as best I can, as little, or as much, as is wanted by my guests. \\r\\n\\r\\n nan 52, year old female, artist, (painter) , hard working, quiet, loves Jamaica Plain, and culture, has a cat.

Hello!\\n\\nWe are Drew and Liesl, your hosts in Boston working together to give you fantastic home away from home experiences. \\n\\nYou will find a clean-as-whistle, thoughtfully appointed apartments with comfortable extra touches; such as high thread count sheets, choice of pillow firmness, and a fully outfitted kitchen. We\\'re available for neighborhood and general travel advice and love hearing from our guests.\\n\\nWhen not working, we both are family oriented people who love to cook, to host friends, and to travel. \\n HELLO-\\r\\nHere\\'s a little bit about me-\\r\\nI studied photography and worked as a professional photographer for the past 25 years. My favorite type of photography is Documentary and photo journalism. You might see some images of my work around my home.\\r\\nI know my city well, and I love giving my guests tips and ideas for fun things to do. So please tell me a little bit about you and why you are coming to Boston. wether you want to stay local and find out more about JP, or if you want to explore the downtown areas of our city, I can guide you. \\r\\nI also consider myself a new urban gardener. I started a small gardening business a few years ago, and I participate in a community garden down the street from my place. \\r\\nI especially love meeting new people and hearing their stories. After traveling through Italy this past Spring (2015) and staying at several airbnb\\'s, I decided to try it myself. I think I will make a great AIRBNB host because I like to make people feel comfortable and I like to chat. We went to Italy to celebrate my daughter\\'s graduation from Syracuse University. We really enjoyed the AIRBNB experiences we had.  \\r\\nMy friends say my home is very welcoming and friendly. Currently, my daughter and another Syracuse Grad are living on the second floor with me and our cute cat named Remi.\\r\\nMy Motto- Share good food with the people you love, explore the world, and treat others the way you want them to treat you. Welcome!\\r\\n\\r\\nI moved to Boston five years ago after having lived for more than 30 years in three different countries on as many continents.  I have a passion for travelling  and, since my migration to Boston, have so enjoyed  the experience of hosting other travelers through Airbnb, in addition to  a non-paying website.  I love that people from vastly different corners of the world, and its multiple paths,  arrive on my doorstep; I also love being of service, and sharing my resources (including my cat. :-)\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m an educator, artist, cook, polyglot, nature-lover, film aficionado, social-justice activist, and mother to an enchanting fur-person.  I try my modest best to live with care, consciousness and compassion.  My nest is my castle and, whether you\\'re here on holiday, or for a work gig,  I would hope that it\\'s a kind of \"home away from home\" for you. Our family has used Air BNB in other cities,  so we thought it would be nice to make our house available in our city.  We have a comfortable house easily accessible by public transportation -- our guest quarters offer privacy and comfort.   \\r\\nWe are active athletic people that enjoy going places to do something - cycle, ski, play tennis/squash etc.\\r\\n nan nan nan I am a Masters student in Behavior Analysis here in Boston.. I work with children with Autism and in my free time I love salsa dancing, travelling, and learning about new cultures! We love meeting creative and positive people.  It is exciting to be able to provide a  wonderful space for travelers to the Boston area. My wife Sefira and I love great food, travel, and all sorts of outdoor things--but we\\'re also homebodies. We really enjoy our home and spending time in it. We\\'ve put a good bit of effort into creating a space that we love and want to be in, and we hope you\\'ll love it, too! nan Jon is a classical musician, Margrit a computer science professor.  We have lived in Boston for over 20 years, love the town, and are happy to give you tips for your visit.  We have traveled extensively around the world ourselves and welcome guests from all cultures and backgrounds. nan Hi! My name is Dawson.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m an outgoing guy interested in sustainability, solar power, and saving the world! I\\'m excited to be hosting on AirBnB in order to meet lots of nice people who want to share my home with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI currently live in Boston, originally from Arizona. I love soccer, sailing, traveling, snowboarding, running and biking. My travels outside the U.S. have brought me as far as Brazil, Peru, Canada, Mexico and Caribbean.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look forward to meeting you. nan We are artists, dancers, travelers, and city dwellers who love good people, good music, good food, & good stories - be it movie, book, tv or other. We love Boston and especially living in JP because of its diversity, culture, walkability, public transportation and proximity to downtown Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe travel all kinds of ways from staying in homes to resorts and appreciate the perks of each. What we love the most about this method of travel is having a base to kick back between excursions and have a snack or breakfast at \"home\" to save a bit of money and calories for the next meal!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs hosts, we keep our place in great condition so you can have a comfortable stay. We want the space to be enjoyed and its important to us that our guests leave happy! We\\'re a family with young children living in Washington, DC.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie likes to eat, make things, do yoga, hang out. She works as a statistician. Lou used to play in indie-bands, but now is climbing the ivory tower studying cities and the built environment. We have a really sweet lab-mix named Belafonte (B for short) who only barks maybe twice a year. Our daughter is the most charming three-year old we know, and the best big sister to her baby brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can\\'t live without coffee, good food, sarcasm, and time off to travel. We\\'ve both traveled fairly extensively, and look forward to more. We are extremely low-maintenance guests, only catch is Lou is allergic to cats.  nan We are Chris and Kristina. We met more than 20 years ago and have lived in Boston ever since. We are both professionals (Kristina works in Higher-Ed and I work for a technology company). We have lived in our 1868 Victorian for over 13 years and love our space in JP.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have lived all over Boston but have always considered Jamaica Plain the best neighborhood in town... partly because it is a true neighborhood. Nowhere else in the city can you be 5-minutes from dense nature that obscures the hustle and bustle of urban life by Jamaica Pond or the Arboretum, while still being minutes from Fenway Park, Longwood medical center, and great restaurants!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have two sons, 13 & 12, and we love to avail ourselves of the city and community we love. We coach baseball, basketball, and flag football, and love to explore, meet new people, and share what we know about Boston with anyone interested. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years we hosted international students coming to Boston to study English and have hosted folks from Korea, Japan, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Kazakhstan. These former guests are now good friends and we enjoyed being their ambassadors to Boston. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe welcome you to our space! Hello! \\r\\nWe are a married couple and have two boys, aged 9 and 11. We are dedicated city dwellers and love our car free life in the city. We moved to Jamaica Plain from the South End neighborhood of Boston in 2014 and it has turned out to be a great choice. JP is  very accessible to the rest of the city, vibrant and a bit quirky! We love the bike paths, parks, tennis courts and baseball fields and all the green space that JP offers. Steve is a web developer, Liesl is a property manager and as a family we love to host dinner parties and guests, travel and have many adventures. We are excited to stay in a yurt on Cape Cod soon and next on the list is an Airbnb treehouse! nan Hello!!  My name is Kaitlin... and I love being an airbnb host! I work in travel and entertainment here in Boston, so being an airbnb host has allowed me not only to supplement my income.... but to have a great time advancing my customer service skills! \\r\\n\\r\\nImportant: I travel often and have a team of folks who help me run this home.

New to AirBNB, excited to host and travel!\\r\\n\\r\\n Hi,\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m a virology scientist working in Boston. Research can be an isolating job so I\\'m excited to be able to meet others from around the world and hear about their lives and exciting travel stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m clean, tidy and quiet.

She found Boston to be exciting, beautiful and more manageable than NYC.  Victoria, Robin\\'s daughter was born in Jamaica Plain (known as JP) in 1993 and now attends MassArt full time as an illustration major.  Victoria lives at The Roost and manages the property as of September 2014 while attending school.  Robin works out of an office in the house so she is there quite often.  Both Robin and Victoria have a passion for good food, wine, art, travel and meeting people.  They enjoy providing memorable experiences, beautiful surroundings and comfort to their guests. Real Estate Investor I\\'m a friendly, self-sufficient, happy high-school teacher who loves to travel during school vacation. I am responsible, respectful, and quiet. I enjoy good food, good shows, reading, going for walks, going to museums, and going jogging. My favorite city is London, but Rome (and its gelato!) is a close second. I am a social worker in pediatrics at a community health center and have lived in Jamaica Plain for 12+ years!\\r\\n\\r\\nI have an 11 year old son and 6 year old daughter who you may meet in passing! I enjoy riding my bike, surfing, gardening, and playing drums. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have two listings that we hope you may consider! One for our entire home and one for just the guest room.  Let me know if you have any questions! We are a couple in our mid-30s, married 10 years, working n the healthcare field. We\\'re pretty quiet and laid back at home. We\\'ve both traveled extensively ourselves, but less so in the recent past, so it\\'s great to get the chance to be hosts and still get the experience of meeting new people!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are welcoming to all! We\\'re active in local glbt/queer social and advocacy groups and are committed allies to people of color (bingo cards, anyone?). 100% safe space for trans* folks. We\\'re also loosely involved on the outskirts of the local alt/burner community.*\\r\\n \\r\\n*If that means something to you, great! If it doesn\\'t, don\\'t worry, it just means we tend towards being a little hippie-ish - very into nature and living sustainably and generally implies that you pursue artistic or other creative (e.g., DIY) projects.  My name is Francisco. Originally from Puerto Rico but I have been living in the US for the past 10 years.\\r\\nI work as a Spanish high school teacher.

I love the neighborhoods where I currently rent for all of its diverse food options within a quick walk, having many attractions (lakes, and sunny nooks, swimming, outdoor concerts, runs, kayaking, bicycling, etc). These are wonderful, dynamic and friendly neighborhoods that I feel fortunate to live in and share. Enjoy! And we look forward to welcome you in Boston, Miami or Florida whichever your destination may be! School teacher and doctor from Boston I\\'m a medical professional in my mid-30s and moved to Boston a few years ago with my lovely wife, who works in education technology and also travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife\\'s profession has made us regular travelers (recent adventures include Easter Island, Ireland, Hong Kong, Germany, Prague, and Hawaii) and we love to chat about the places we\\'ve been--especially restaurants! \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'re both curious and active. We are life-long learners who love to read.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'re big fans of the AirBnB concept, and our travel has gotten much more interesting and special by choosing to stay in unique local homes instead of sterile hotels. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs hosts, we generally take our cues from our guests: we know that some have a busy schedule and just need a no-fuss place to crash, while others are more extroverted and don\\'t mind chatting and hanging out in the evenings or over breakfast. Let us know what we can do to make your trip special and memorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe love meeting new people, and we both drink a LOT of coffee.  Real Estate Investor One half yuppy/professional one half free spirit I currently reside in the hip, artistic, and nature-filled town of Jamaica Plain (Boston) Massachusetts.  I love strolling around town in the afternoon, coffee dates with friends, and of course, traveling!  I am out of town a fair amount either traveling for pleasure, visiting friends and family, or the occasional work trip.  When I\\'m at home I typically enjoy a little R&R including lazy mornings and quiet evenings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m easy to get along with, and fairly adventurous.  I enjoy everything from luxurious hot spring destinations to third world countries.  Recent travels have included Europe, Bali, Cambodia, and of course USA and Mexico!  I\\'ve got the bug and can\\'t wait for more - I am fascinated with people and humanity, which includes the history and culture of each place I visit.  As a traveler I spend a lot of time wandering around places, people watching, or finding quiet places to enjoy the nature and try to stay fairly centrally located so I can walk and take things in slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy best friend and co-host, Leah, lives just a couple streets away and looks after my place and my guests while I am away.  She is a wonderful hostess and cook, a renegade queen life coach, potter and a long time resident of the beautiful city of Boston who looks forward to facilitating your comfortable stay in my home.   I am a teacher heading on a cross-country road trip for the summer. It seems like a shame for my great apartment to go to waste - especially during the best time of the year in Boston! We are nice, clean and friendly couple from Boston. We are both PhD student at Boston University and MIT. Designer, fine artist, classical musician, landscaper with progressive views.  This is Boston, after all. I\\'m from Boston and I love to travel! We are both avid travelers and love the idea of offering a place to stay for people coming to our area. We are happy to help you with any information you might need to make your trip better. Javier speaks Spanish and Portuguese and lives for soccer - so if you are looking for a pick-up game while you are here, do check in with him.  And we both can certainly point you in the right direction for some fantastic food and drinks. We look forward to meeting you!  Hi. Kenji here. I  don\\'t like describing my self. Writing from my home in the JP neighborhood of Boston. Today I got to stay at home. I work freelance in film production so I get a lot of time off between projects. My job is best described as \"art department\" although, set builder, propmaker, prop, effects, set dresser... are other terms for the work I do. Anyway, art dept. is what I write on my time cards. Today I did none of that. I fixed up a couple of 80\\'s Japanese road bikes and one 60\\'s Raleigh 3 speed in the sun in front of our house. Me and my daughter are getting ready to go down to NYC where we will set up our wares for sale on the street in Brooklyn (15 bikes and a table of her arts and crafts). Can\\'t wait. It\\'s super fun to be on the street talking to the people, hearing the music from the passing traffic, smiling at the ladies, eating crazy street food, and putting people on nice bikes. This is the best kind of day for me. It\\'s got everything, travel, all kinds of people, my daughter w/ me, friends dropping by, a couple bucks in my pocket, truck tacos, street fashion... Magdalena , my 15 year old, creative, self possessed, funny, daughter makes me feel proud and secure when she hawks her crafts. I look at her talk everyone, so confident, open hearted but savvy, and I feel like she\\'s gonna be okay where ever she goes. The art of survival. I\\'m an artist. Sculptor. Went to art school. Can make anything. But what I love most to make is my way thru life. It\\'s the best art. But unlike art it is totally accessible because everyone does it. blaa blaa... back to today... I also did some drawings for a chicken coop that I\\'m going to build next week with my buddy Jenny. Some local chicken activists approached us with the project. These chicken people want to repeal laws that prevent keeping chickens in the city of Boston. They would like to display some chickens at our local earth/may day festival in a clean,(hopefully) well designed, urban chicken coop. What else? I fixed the passenger side headlight of my truck, paid some bills, ate some mochi, did the dark laundry, made some calls to spread the word about a friend who is on his last legs in a fight w/cancer, pulled some bamboo shoots that were creeping ever further out of their corner of the yard. Magdalena came home tonight beaming. There was an after school dance, ice cream with friends afterwards and thrift shopping after that. She sat on the couch and gave me a play by play of her day. I love that\\r\\nWell, there it is. I think that worked out pretty good. It\\'s a good thing I didn\\'t work today or you\\'d of heard all about it...\\r\\nIE: today I built a city diorama in 1\":1\\' scale. Went pretty smooth but the tiny bus stop benches looked gigantic next to the wee news paper boxes. Weird because both were built with out straying from the 1\":1\\' format. It just goes to show you, sometimes it\\'s best to set the rules aside and go with your eye and your heart. \\r\\nAnyway we want to stay at your house and we want you to stay at ours. Beantown Suites is the Award Winning (2014 & 2015 Tower of Excellence Award Winners!) Furnished housing provider based in Boston.

We also offer Uber credits, Washio Credits, and Free Drizly alcohol delivery! nan Looking to travel the world. Love biking, good music, cooking and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoy traveling light and REALLY experiencing the city. No tourist stops for me, we wanna know what its like to live as a citizen in your city. nan I am a quiet person. I like meeting new people. I work a lot but often from home. I\\'m originally from NY (Westchester County), I moved to Boston for school an fell in love with the city. I have been here for 13 years.  nan I am a Masters student in Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University. I am from Brazil, and live with other Brazilian roommates in a nice location in Boston. We are very friendly and receptive!   nan nan I have been hosting people from all over the world through Airbnb for more than three years now and have really enjoyed the experience. Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That\\'s what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. \\r\\nJust like all of the travelers that I\\'ve hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you\\'re looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. \\r\\nSpeaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it\\'s just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!\\r\\nWhat keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone\\'s visit memorable! I am a relatively easy going. I am fortunate to have had a fairly cosmopolitan life; lived in different parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a busy medical professional. However, I try not to be single-faceted or get consumed with my work. I enjoy a good brunch, having breakfast for dinner, coffee, biographies, creative fiction, urban gardening, running, Amazon Prime ... and a good night sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course I enjoy traveling: solo, with friends, to resorts, and to anywhere my wallet and time allows. \\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 2016-\\r\\nlast books: The Lowland, Dead Wake- the Last Crossing of the Lusitania\\r\\nlatest music obsession: Kygo, Calvin Harris, Lorde, Sia, Kiesza, Of Monsters and Men, Cold Play \\r\\npodcasts: BBC World Service, Invisibilia, This American Life, Serial, Planet Money, The New Yorker Comment\\r\\nfood: Mediterranean, hummus, baked salmon, stinky soft or blue cheese, greek yogurt\\r\\nbeverage of choice: Strong coffee, Riesling, Malbec, Cider\\r\\nongoing personal project: improving my French, training marathon nan I am an entrepreneur, small business owner, avid runner, and lover of the outdoors who is proud to call the Jamaica Plain/Mission Hill area my lifelong home.

Thank you for checking out my profile! \\nI am a relatively new member at airbnb and could not be more excited about this new journey in my life - having spent the last 20 years in the fascinating world of finance - I could not be more open to a change in scenery. Although I love finance - meeting and hosting people from all over the world has an extraordinary appeal to me. I raised six children - yours, mine and ours. They range from ages 19 through 24 - a true Brady Bunch - 3 girls and 3 boys. All of them are doing wonderful things and have moved to school, serving in the military or have started their own family. Like a significant amount of \"middle aged,\" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.\\n Hi, I am Annie, a student with an empty room in a great location  nan Relaxed,  Easy going, Accommodating.  nan A fun bartender  from Boston who obviously loves mixing drinks, cooking, eating out, traveling and enjoying life  nan Born and raised in Boston, to parents from former Portuguese islands in the Atlantic ocean.

I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I\\'m usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn\\'t sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. \\r\\n\\r\\n I\\'m writing from Boston\\'s Historic South End, it\\'s 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon\\'s Finish Line. I\\'m still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a \"people\\'s sporting event\". We are a city with many \"sport\\'s palaces\" but this event is for the every citizen. It\\'s not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It\\'s a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.\\r\\nNow it\\'s 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I\\'m in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen\\'s Hallelujah and I don\\'t remember his exact words but they went something like... \"Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen\\'s, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses.\" He went on. \"A song that needs so many verses because Cohen\\'s asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nReuben\\'s words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It\\'s was a moment I\\'ll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I\\'ll never forget. I don\\'t remember Reuben\\'s exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot\\'s, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I\\'ve walked countless times, there\\'s more sudden senseless death. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis time let\\'s not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY CAREER & INTERESTS\\r\\nI\\'m a retired professor of Management and Accounting, Massasoit Community College.

This allows me to balance the value of maintaining the single family configuration of such a grand home with the inherent financial and environmental cost.  nan Your hosts Dympna and James take pride in making you feel at home.

I went to elementary, high school and university in this incredible city. My boyfriend, Jason, grew up in Hong Kong and came to Boston for college. He and I travel internationally for several months durng the year, but always come back to this city for its incredible food, fun atmosphere, and because it\\'s our home.  We live in the \\'burbs (about 15 minutes away) with our Siberian Husky.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two of us have grown up traveling. We\\'ve experienced five-star accommodations from our previous \"business\" careers in management consulting and accounting. We have also traveled through the Jordanian desert sleeping in Bedouin tents and with Northern Thailand families in bamboo huts. The common denominator that we feel makes a wonderful accommodation is when a home-y and comfortable space.  We\\'ve designed the apartment with this in mind. All ceramic pottery pieces were designed by my Aunt Sally. All framed prints and canvases were photographed by Jason or myself. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen traveling, our main focus is always food. We love our meats and seafood.  The one thing that makes my eyes pop is dessert. Jason is all about his red wine, scotch and other classic drinks.  Our second focus is the local experience. There is so much more to a city than historical buildings, duck  boat tours, and the Freedom trail (all of which are amazing).  There are the North End side streets for delicious lobster rolls, local markets (like the South End SOWA), and really interesting one-day volunteer opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\n We think a great trip starts with a 5-star host.

Other favorites include Northern Ethiopia, Buenos Aires, Argentina, San Francisco, Tzfat, Israel and Santorini, Greece. I love to read, exercise, play in my band, explore cities, hike, and hope to see as much of the world as possible!

I live in Boston and I\\'m excited to share my condo with you.  Boston is a great city with so much to see and experience.  I\\'m a foodie who loves to cook, read, workout, travel and spend time with my wife & young son. Scientist at MIT, traveller of the world and life. I enjoy hosting people from all over the world at my place. So welcome! I have been hosting people from all over the world through Airbnb for more than three years now and have really enjoyed the experience. Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That\\'s what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. \\r\\nJust like all of the travelers that I\\'ve hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you\\'re looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. \\r\\nSpeaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it\\'s just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!\\r\\nWhat keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone\\'s visit memorable! Scientist at MIT, traveller of the world and life. I enjoy hosting people from all over the world at my place. So welcome! Boston born and raised.\\nI love exploring the city! Even though I have been here for over 20 years I always find something new. Walking on the charles or a new little restaurant. My favorite area is the Seaport in Boston.

I took a break from airbnb to focus my time on work and grad school, but am excited to start hosting again!\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a high school English teacher and travel aficionado. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am energentic and enjoy meeting new people. \\r\\n\\r\\nNevada, my dog, is named after the state in which I found her, abandoned at a rest stop almost ten years ago. She is amazing!\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides Nevada, my interests range from wine, running, cheesey pop music, documentaries to just good old fashioned conversation. \\r\\n\\r\\nBoston has proudly been my home for close to 10 years. I can tell you about some great spots, getting around, dining in fantastic restaurants and great running routes. I am happy to help you with your Boston experience!\\r\\n\\r\\n I have been hosting people from all over the world through Airbnb for more than three years now and have really enjoyed the experience. Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That\\'s what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. \\r\\nJust like all of the travelers that I\\'ve hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you\\'re looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. \\r\\nSpeaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it\\'s just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!\\r\\nWhat keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone\\'s visit memorable! Edward & Alan \\r\\nWe are fun loving, very honest & hard working.\\r\\nLove the arts, movies, plays as well as sporting events, but above all love to travel.\\r\\nFamily time is most important, and as your host, consider yourself, part of our family.\\r\\nThey say treat people as you would like to be treated, and \"royalty\" is what sums that up.\\r\\nWe look forward to your stay, and seeing you here in Boston!\\r\\n\\r\\n- Edward & Alan\\r\\n  nan nan I live in the Back Bay and I\\'m happy to accommodate any unique requests.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, my mother\\'s residential real estate office, Meridian Realty Group, is located on the ground floor of our Gloucester Street brownstone / townhouse, facilitating easy communication and immediate assistance with any issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince\\'s hotel investments across North America and Europe.

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That\\'s what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. \\r\\nJust like all of the travelers that I\\'ve hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you\\'re looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. \\r\\nSpeaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it\\'s just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!\\r\\nWhat keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone\\'s visit memorable! nan nan nan nan In my early 20s, student at Harvard University.

I grew up in New York City and I\\'ve been living in Boston for about six years now. I\\'ve lived in several different neighborhoods (Allston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Fenway/Kenmore) and work downtown so I know a lot about Boston and its surrounding areas! I enjoy biking (it\\'s the best way to get around the city, in my opinion), cooking, and gardening. Lately I\\'ve been watching Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and House of Cards. Hablo un poco español... pero ¡quiero practicar! nan nan I am a retired educator.  I like to refer to myself as a retired elementary teacher although I spent the last quarter of my career as an administrator.  But my teaching years were my best.  The daily student teacher interaction, the laughter and frustrations, the little signs of progress, made the work so fulfilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nI grew up on a very successful produce and dairy farm in Southeastern Massachusetts.  Our main cash crop was tomatoes but we raised all kinds of vegetables.  They were trucked into Boston.  In the winter the dairy supported us.  My childhood exposed me to hard work but also to a love for the outdoors and nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of college I worked for the Department of Defense as a teacher in their overseas dependents\\' schools.  I taught in Istanbul and Seville, Spain.  I was able to travel extensively through Europe for three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon returning to the States I began teaching in Quincy, Massachusetts, where I remained for thirty years.  The last seven years were spent as a principal of an elementary school which has a majority population of Asian students.  I traveled to China one summer to explore my students\\' heritage and culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the interim I married Joyce Brothers.  Joyce is a case manager for Boston Senior Home Care.  Her passion is cooking and she is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and I have raised two children.  Our daughter is a school teacher.  Our son, born in Brazil, is a hair stylist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a life-long learner I am a proponent of travel.  Whether for pleasure or business,  travel is the portal to understanding.

A story has a start, an idea, and a time frame. What makes each story exclusively beautiful is the uncertainty of those parameters and the random unfolding of events that will succeed.

I would like to know and meet people from all over the world. :)  I am a young professional working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft.

We love outdoor activities, festivals, craft beer, hockey (not the Bruins!), the Sox, and traveling. We love to use AirBnB when we travel (to rent and host). We are both extremely responsible, considerate, and clean people, so we look to rent to/from people of similar dispositions.   We are a small European-style guest house, catering primarily to the economy traveller. We\\'re not a fancy place, so don\\'t be expecting a first class hotel, there\\'s no big fancy lobby, pool or room service, but we do feel that our place is a good value. Our prices include parking and airconditioning. We\\'re in a great location to get around the city, two blocks from the subway, and less than a quarter mile from Exit 18 of interstate 90. If you\\'re looking on a map, we\\'re just west of Boston University, and six blocks north of John Kennedy\\'s birthplace. I\\'m told I have good interpersonal skills, but I thrive off of working alone.  I sleep more than I should, and I love to cook good healthy food.  I am primarily self-employed, and I wouldn\\'t have it any other way.  I love the satisfaction of working really hard, and finally getting that payoff.  And I will never compromise my integrity to achieve a goal.  We are a small European-style guest house, catering primarily to the economy traveller.

Hi I look forward to meeting you!\\r\\nA little bit about myself and my home:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the \"go to\" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. \\r\\n\\r\\nI started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.

Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.\\r\\n nan I am a scientist and a physician doing medical research and clinical work in Boston, Massachusetts. I studied Physics, Medicine, and Medical Imaging. I finished my nuclear medicine training and currently doing my surgical intensive care unit training. I look for a deeper understanding of time and its effect on health, and cognitive perception. Every person has a story. I think of it in terms of a time lapse. A story has a start, an idea, and a time frame. What makes each story exclusively beautiful is the uncertainty of those parameters and the random unfolding of events that will succeed. Airbnb brings to the table all those ingredients and ignites the uncertainty principle. I am from Beirut and have traveled the Caribbean, Europe and USA. Looking forward towards my far east visits when time permits.   ...
